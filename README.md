App for students to generate samples to use for Hypothesis testing
# 🏋️ Monday Workout Statistics App

**Live App:** https://cynthialmcginnis.github.io/mondayWorkOutStats

An interactive web application for statistics students to practice **two-sample hypothesis testing** and **confidence intervals** using real-world fitness data.

## 📊 Research Question

**"Do people who work out on Monday expend more calories per week than those who do not work out on Monday?"**

## 🎯 Educational Purpose

This app is designed for statistics students to:
- Practice **two-sample t-tests**
- Calculate **confidence intervals**
- Work with **realistic health data**
- Understand **scientific measurement methods**
- Connect **statistics to real-world applications**

## 🔬 How It Works

### Calorie Calculation Method
The app calculates calories burned using the scientifically accurate **MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) formula**:

```
Calories Burned = MET × Weight (kg) × Duration (hours)
```

### MET Values Used
- **HIIT**: 8.0 MET (High Intensity Interval Training)
- **Cycling**: 7.5 MET (Stationary bike, moderate intensity)
- **Strength**: 6.0 MET (Weight training, moderate)
- **Aqua**: 5.5 MET (Water aerobics)
- **Yoga**: 3.0 MET (General yoga practice)

### Class Durations
- **Yoga**: 75 minutes (1.25 hours)
- **Most classes**: 60 minutes (1.0 hour)
- **HIIT**: 45 minutes (0.75 hours)

## 👨‍🏫 For Instructors

### Key Features
- ✅ Generates **unique samples** of size 15 for each student
- ✅ **Two clear groups**: Monday workout vs. Non-Monday workout
- ✅ **Complete hypothesis test setup** with H₀ and H₁
- ✅ **Automatic calculations** for means, standard deviations, t-statistics
- ✅ **Interactive charts** and data tables
- ✅ **Mobile-responsive** design for any device

### Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
1. Set up appropriate null and alternative hypotheses
2. Calculate sample statistics (mean, standard deviation)
3. Perform two-sample t-tests
4. Interpret p-values and make statistical conclusions
5. Construct confidence intervals for the difference between means
6. Connect statistical analysis to real-world health scenarios

### Classroom Implementation
1. **Individual Practice**: Each student generates their own sample
2. **Group Comparison**: Compare results across different samples
3. **Discussion Points**: Why do results vary? What does this teach us about sampling?
4. **Extensions**: Calculate confidence intervals, discuss practical significance

## 👩‍🎓 For Students

### How to Use
1. **Visit the app**: Click the link above
2. **Generate your sample**: Click "Generate New Sample (n=15)"
3. **Analyze your data**: Use the provided statistics for your hypothesis test
4. **Take notes**: Record your sample number and results
5. **Repeat if needed**: Generate new samples to see how results vary

### Your Assignment Tasks
Using your generated sample, complete the following:

#### 1. Hypothesis Test Setup
- **H₀**: μ₁ = μ₂ (No difference in weekly calories between groups)
- **H₁**: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (There is a difference in weekly calories)
- **α**: 0.05 (significance level)

#### 2. Record Your Data
- Sample size for Monday group: n₁ = ____
- Sample size for Non-Monday group: n₂ = ____
- Sample mean for Monday group: x̄₁ = ____ calories
- Sample mean for Non-Monday group: x̄₂ = ____ calories
- Sample standard deviation for Monday group: s₁ = ____
- Sample standard deviation for Non-Monday group: s₂ = ____

#### 3. Calculate Test Statistic
- Use the provided t-statistic: t = ____
- Degrees of freedom: df = ____
- Standard error: SE = ____

#### 4. Make Your Conclusion
- Compare your t-statistic to critical values
- State your conclusion in context
- Discuss practical vs. statistical significance
